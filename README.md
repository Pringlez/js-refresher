In this exercise we will refresh our JavaScript skills.

## Exercises
1. Make sure you have node installed

1. Download the files in this repository and open the directory in Brackets.

1. Run refresher.js in node.

1. Comment each line in refresher.js, explaining what it does.

1. Create a function in refresher.js that takes a single integer argument, squares it, adds two, and returns that value (x -> x^2 + 2). Test that the function works by applying it to the value 8 and outputting the result to the console.

1. Create a list of the even numbers from 1 to 60.

1. Apply the function  to the list of numbers, outputting the result to the console.

1. Create an object called connection that has two variables: ip_address and port.

1. Add a method to the object called change_port() that takes a single argument, a port number, and changes the port variable to that value.

1. Show that the method works by outputting some value to the console.

## Advanced exercises

1. Use a constructor to create a list of 100 connection objects, each with a random port and random (valid) IP address.
